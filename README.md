## üìñ DevOps Tools I've learned
Git: Version control system for managing source code. 
Jenkins: Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool. 
Docker: Containerization tool for building and deploying applications. 
Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform for automating containerized application deployment, scaling, and management. 
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources
GitLab CI: CI/CD tool integrated with GitLab for automating code delivery pipelines.

## üìù Summarized Blogs
Blog 1: Exploring the Basics of Container and Virtualization Technology in DevOps
This blog introduces the concepts of virtualization and containerization in DevOps. Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server, optimizing hardware usage and enhancing disaster recovery. Containers, on the other hand, provide lightweight, portable environments for applications, ensuring consistency across different stages of development and deployment. Both technologies play key roles in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and scalable microservices. By improving collaboration and scalability, they are essential for modern DevOps practices, driving more efficient and reliable software development pipelines.

Blog 2:Understanding Kyverno: A Kubernetes-Native Policy Engine
In this blog, I've introduced Kyverno, a Kubernetes-native policy engine that simplifies enforcing security, governance, and resource optimization within Kubernetes clusters using YAML-based policies. Kyverno allows for validation, mutation, and generation of Kubernetes resources without requiring a new programming language. Key use cases include enhancing security, ensuring governance standards, and automating resource configurations. Additionally, I‚Äôve provided a step-by-step guide to installing Kyverno using Helm or YAML manifests and demonstrated creating a simple policy to ensure all pods have a required label. Kyverno‚Äôs ease of use and Kubernetes-native approach make it a valuable tool for maintaining secure and organized clusters.
