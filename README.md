## üìå **DevOps Tools Explored**  
Here are the tools I‚Äôve mastered during this course:  

- **Git**: Version control for managing and tracking changes in source code.  
- **Jenkins**: Automates Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.  
- **Docker**: Streamlines application development through containerization.  
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates and manages containerized workloads.  
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automating cloud resource provisioning.  
- **GitLab CI**: CI/CD solution tightly integrated with GitLab for efficient workflows.

## üìù **Blog Summaries**  

### **Blog 1: Exploring the Basics of Container and Virtualization Technology in DevOps**  
This blog introduces the foundational concepts of **virtualization** and **containerization** in DevOps.  
- **Virtualization** allows multiple virtual machines to share a single physical server, optimizing resources and enhancing disaster recovery.  
- **Containers**, being lightweight and portable, ensure consistency across development and deployment stages.  
Key roles include enhancing **CI/CD**, **IaC**, and **microservices** architectures. Both technologies boost collaboration and scalability, making them indispensable for modern DevOps pipelines.  

### **Blog 2: Understanding Kyverno - A Kubernetes-Native Policy Engine**  
Kyverno simplifies policy enforcement in Kubernetes clusters through YAML-based configurations.  
- Supports **validation**, **mutation**, and **resource generation** of Kubernetes resources.  
- Ensures **security**, **governance**, and automation of resource configurations.  
This blog also includes a step-by-step guide to installing Kyverno using **Helm** and YAML manifests, with a demonstration of creating policies for enforcing cluster-wide compliance.
